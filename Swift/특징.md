## UIViewController, UINavigationController, UITabBarViewController
- UIViewController, UINavigationController은 원하는 만큼 ViewController를 stack에 쌓을 수 있지만
- UITabBarViewController는 고정된 갯수의 ViewController만 스택에 쌓을 수 있다.

```
You can add as many UIViewControllers to a UINavigationController as you need, 
and can add and remove view controllers from the stack at any time.

This is in contrast to the UITabBarViewController, 
which you'll learn about later in the course, and which manages a fixed number of view controllers.
```
